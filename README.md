# lexah-ionicsample
Ionic side menu sample written in lexah.

You'll need [lexah](github.com/peekmo/lexah) in order to transpile the project.
Also need [ionic.haxe](https://github.com/JJayet/ionic.haxe) and [angular.haxe](https://github.com/frabbit/angular.haxe)

After, just run ```haxe build.hxml``` to build the ```index.js```
